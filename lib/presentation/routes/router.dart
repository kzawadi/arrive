/*
Using Auto route helps a lot in  navigation it allows for strongly-typed
arguments passing , effortless deep-linking and is uses code generation to
simplify routes setup

This will eliminated the boilerplate and a need to to use named/generated
routes and youâ€™ll end up writing a lot of boilerplate code for mediator argument
classes, checking for required arguments, extracting arguments and a bunch of 
other stuff. AutoRoute does all that for you and much more.
